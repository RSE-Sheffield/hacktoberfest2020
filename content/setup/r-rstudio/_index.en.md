During the collaborative exercise and if you want to follow the R & Rstudio practical, we will collate materials from each participant which will feed into an R analysis. If you would like to run this analysis yourself locally, you will need to have **R** and **Rstudio** installed. This however is optional and not a requirement for you to complete the workshop.

### R
R can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

### RStudio
RStudio is an environment for developing R code.

It can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
You will need the Desktop version (> 1.0) for your computer.

### R :package: `usethis`

We will also be using R package `usethis`

You can install it with:

```r
install.packages("usethis")
```
