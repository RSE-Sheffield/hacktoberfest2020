# Hacktoberfest Sheffield 2020

We'll start with an introduction to open source and [Hackoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Then we'll be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) to explore and contribute to open-source projects with some hands-on tutorials in breakout sessions using either the RStudio or GitKraken interfaces or command line git (your choice!).

We hope you'll finish the session having made your first Hacktoberfest pull request!
