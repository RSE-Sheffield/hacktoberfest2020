Contributing to Open Source Software
====================================

:wave: Welcome!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm Bob, I like science, code and records.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Welcome to Hacktoberfest 2020!

- A one month celebration of Open Source on GitHub.

- all about meaningful contribution to the open source ecosystem.

- Make *4* pull requests to a public repository on GitHub to get a t-shirt 
    - don't need to be accepted

### What is Open Source?

> Software whose source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to **study, change, and distribute** the software to anyone and for any purpose.

https://choosealicense.com/

---

### Examples

Linux, Firefox, R & R packages, Python, [Apollo-11](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11), [BBC Data Unit](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit), This Talk!

---

### Why open source?

- Open and reproducible research
- Less need to reinvent
- Lower costs

---

### An open source challenge:

--

> Multiple contibutors to the same code with different ideas about what it should look like.

--

*Needs **people** and **software tools**.*

---

### Tools: Git & GitHub

Tools that enable version control and open collaboration:
- git
- GitHub
- GitKraken
- RStudio
- VSCode

## Open source is about people

- Be nice! Often maintainers are volunteers
