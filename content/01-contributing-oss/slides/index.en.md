- A one month celebration of Open Source on GitHub.

- Meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem.

- *4* pull requests to a public repository on GitHub to get a t-shirt or a tree (don't need to be accepted).

### What is Open Source?

> Software whose source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to **study, change, and distribute** the software to anyone and for any purpose.

https://choosealicense.com/

### Examples

[Linux](https://thelinuxfoundation.org), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/), [R & R packages](https://www.r-project.org/), [python](https://www.python.org/), [Apollo-11](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11), [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), [This Talk](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/hacktoberfest2020)!

---

### Why open source?

- Open and reproducible research
- Less need to reinvent
- Lower costs sometimes (e.g. cloud OS)
- Find collaborators

---

### An open source challenge:

--

> Multiple contibutors to the same code with different ideas about what it should look like.

--

*Needs **people** and **software tools**.*

### Hacktoberfest guiding values:

#### Everyone is welcome! 

<p style="font-size:50%">Participants in Hacktoberfest represented 151 countries and thousands of unique skill sets. This program welcomes everyone already whoâ€™s already part of the open source software community, and anyone who is interested in sectioning in.</p>

#### Quantity is fun, quality is key.

<p style="font-size:50%">Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building. However, it all begins with meaningful contributions to open source software.</p>

#### Short-term action, long-term impact. 

<p style="font-size:50%">In the open source software community, we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long after October. This is a voyage not a race.</p>
